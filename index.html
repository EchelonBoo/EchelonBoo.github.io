				<h3 class="feature-title" id="About">About Me</h3>
				
				<p>I am a 20-year-old Software Development student in Limerick, Ireland. Throughout my teenage years I was a big advocate for political engagement with young people and took part in many organisations and represented my county on a national level as a voice for young people in the government. This mixed with my passion for soccer and playing on the local lady’s team, has given me very extensive teamwork skills and communication that stand to me in my life today.</p>
				
				<p>Since i started my college course in LIT, my passion and interest in the growing world of technology has grown massively. I spend most of my time learning new languages, reading documentation and staying up to date with new advancements in the area. I work very hard in college and to date I have gained a first-class honours GPA. If you are interested in the work I have done in college or projects I've been working on, please see my <a href="https://github.com/EchelonBoo" target="_blank">Github</a> page.</p>
				
				<p>If you would like to know more about me or request to see my CV you can check out the <a href="#" target="_blank">Contact Me </a>section of my portfolio website.</p>

			<h3 class="feature-title" id="Projects">My Projects</h3>
			<p>Throughout my last two years in college I have worked on many cool and interesting projects, individually as well as in a group, the following is a list of my favourites. To see my code or ask me a question about a project, please see my <a href="https://github.com/EchelonBoo" target="_blank">Github</a> page.</p>
			<p><ul>
			
				<li>Elective App: This is an application that I built as part of my C# classes. It works as an add-on system to the current college system that allows you to choose electives for students, update them etc.</li>
				
				<li>Weather App: This is a simple little console application built in C++, that works as a little weather system for a news station.</li>
			
				<li>Office Supply Shop: This was a group project written in C# and using GUI. The application works as a system for an office supply shop and manages their sales and products. My contribution to the project is the Sales section.</li>
			
				<li>Python Client-Servers: On my Github page there are two of these projects. The first one allows the client to enter a string and the server will respond confirming if the string was made up of solely letters. The second one lets the client enter a number and the server responds confirming wether or not the number is a power of two.</li>
